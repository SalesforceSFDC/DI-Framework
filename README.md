## Force.com IoC/DI framework

This project is for the evolution of a framework to assist in the management of interfaces and implementations within the Force.com platform. And to provide a structured way to find, full fill and instantiate these dependencies at run time.

More information on the development of this framework can be found on my [blog](http://smgoodyear.com/2012/04/15/force-com-dependency-management-a-first-pass/)

### How does this class help me?

Wel all know decoupling our systems is good and systems on the Force.com platform are no different - this project should make that process easier for developers to repeat time and time again. As well as hopefully improving the maintainability of the code base.

### What's still missing?

Lots of things - at the minute this is very much a starting point.

### Who's contributed to this?
